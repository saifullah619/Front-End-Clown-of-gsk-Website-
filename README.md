# Front-End-Clown-of-gsk-Website-
After completing "The complete Web Developer Course" From Udemy. I recreated the www.gsk.com home page to practise what I have learned in the course. 
This project was done with Basics of HTML5 and CSS3 and this was the first Frontend work of mine.
I intend to improve this work by using Bootstap and jQuery and In near time I am gonna improve it
